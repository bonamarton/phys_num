Numerical Methods for Physics

_______________________________________________

## Informations:

### From the project:

Various numerical methods, written in C language.

### This project contains:

The project contains four main topic:

1. Matrix multipication:
The program can multiplicat row, column vectors, matrices and their combinations

2. Gauss-Jordan elimination:
Their are two version, first is the standard algorithmic solution,
second version contains singular-value decomposition (SVD) method.
For SVD, LAPACK needed. You can get from [here](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack/)
In simple case (in win ops sys), decompress lapacke.rar (in "gauss_jordan_elim") to "gauss_jordan_elim" folder, and it will work.
